# MergeCubes3DGame
It's a 3D game that still in development. Made with THREEJS. 

If you open index.html file it will automatically loads and opens the level as currentLevel hard coded in Game class. There is no timer, win or lose situations either checks. 

You can change levels by adjusting currentLevel parameter (in Game.js)

I made for educational and commercial purposes both but not sure if I finish soon. So uploading here just in case.

You need to run server in order to game work.
